# Install Ideas 2025

* What order should things happen in?
  * Manually, before script?
  * mball.co/setup | bash
  * then fastest to productivity.
* Before running script:
  * macOS install succeeds.
  * setup bash, and home directory as expected
  * have background installed xcode tools / git.
*
* Dropbox / loading files should come first.
  * Load the files, then link them?


```
rclone copy nas:/dropbox ~/Dropbox \
  --transfers=10 \
  --checkers=20 \
  --buffer-size=32M \
  --multi-thread-streams=4   --fast-list \
  --use-mmap \
  --progress
```

* Finder font size settings
* Add a bunch of brew cask apps
* add brew cask-font
* setup iCloud
* setup tabbing settings

## Personal Settings

* move dotfiles out of ~/Dropbox/Projects to just ~/Dropbox
* move other stuff from Dropbox to iCloud drive or Google

## Stuff I manually had to setup

* turn on iCloud drive sync
* setup finder column view / sort, size, settings
* setup finder sidebar
* Launchbar prefs
* 1Password settings
  * option toggle, no menu icon, no auto-submit
  * turn on dev settings
  * Set default vault
* VS Code and signing into GitHub
  * Sync works OK, but can I get the first run to be easier?
* Review the installers/ directory on the NAS and go through all of those.

## Post Login script

* Seems like some things need to be done after logout/login once
* Set terminal font and them to SCP font
