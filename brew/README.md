# Homebrew Setup

* `Brewfile` contains all packages I have, semi-regularly exported/updated.
* `*.brewfile` are setups for common app bundles.

## Future ideas:

* setup a cronjob to export the brewfile
* update install scripts to iterate through `*.brewfile`

## To Sort

`to-sort.brewfile` contains all of the lines from `Brewfile` which are not already in a `*.brewfile`.
